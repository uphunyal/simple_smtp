# simple_smtp
Your task is to develop a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. Your client will need to
connect to a mail server, dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, and send an email
message to the mail server.

Mail servers like Google mail (address: smtp.gmail.com, port: 587) requires your client to add a
Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for authentication and security
reasons, before you send MAIL FROM command. Add TLS/SSL commands to your existing ones
and implement your client using Google mail server at above address and port.
